"% of median international price paid for a set of tracer medicines that was part of the last regular MOH procurement","PS03","Continuous","Procurement","""This indicator tracks the potential overspending/savings on tracer medicines. Median international price is the median free on board (FOB) price from a set of international suppliers, adjusted to reflect estimated cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) prices. One source of price information is the MSH International Drug Price Indicator Guide. The last regular procurement price refers to the CIF price paid during the last regular MOH procurement.""","Does the country track the procurement prices of tracer medicines (as determined by the country)?

If data are collected from different levels of the system, a separate average should be calculated for each level. If a country has more than one public institution, the one that serves the poorest people according to the national poverty level should be chosen to assess using this indicator. If procurement is decentralized, the average procurement price should be used. For instance, if the Ministry of Health institutions are providing services to the poorest patients, the Ministry of Health procurement should be assessed.""
	
	The computation involves two steps:
	""First, the percentages are calculated for each of the tracer medicines by dividing the purchase cost of the comparison unit (e.g., tablet, milliliter, etc.) at the last regular MOH procurement by the median international price of that unit and multiplying the result by 100%.""
	
	
	
	""Second, the average percentage for all tracer medicines is calculated by summing their percentages and dividing by the total number on the list.""","""The original source of the indicator does not set a specific target value. It is important that countries identify their baseline and measure trends over time. Ideally, the median price ratio is below or equal to 100%, however, it is unrealistic to expect that for all tracer medicines a median international price or lower is achieved. Cameron et al found that the median price ratio depends on the income level of the country where the median price ratio is lower for lower income countries than for higher income countries.""
	
	""Comparison of procurement price indices across countries may be useful to compare and contrast the efficiency of procurement processes in different systems, though context (country size, accessibility to transport, income level, etc.) are important contextual factors when attempting to compare across countries.""

When this happens they are characterized as being catastrophic. Within the SDG monitoring framework (SDG indicator 3.8.2), the proportion of the population facing catastrophic expenditures is measured as the population weighted average of the number of households with “large household expenditures on health” as a share of total household expenditure or income (household’s budget).

It would be preferable to use an indicator that assesses out of pocket expenditure specifically on medicines, compared with household ability to pay, but this indicator is not routinely collected. This indicator has been chosen because countries are required to report it for monitoring the sustainable development goals. This is an imperfect proxy to assess medicine affordability in terms of ability to pay.""","""WHO global health observatory – SDG indicators, National Health Accounts, Household budget surveys, Household income and expenditure surveys, Household socioeconomic and living standards surveys""","""The global and regional incidence of the proportion of the population with household expenditures on health greater than 10% of total household expenditure or income is estimated as the population weighted average of the country level share of people with such catastrophic health expenditures (SDG 3.8.2, 10% threshold) for a reference year. Incidence at the country level for the reference year is estimated using different methods depending upon the availability of information for that country around or at the reference year (T*). • In countries for which there is an observed incidence rate of the SDG indicator 3.8.2 at the 10% threshold in the reference year T*, this point is used. • When there are at least two observed incidence rates of the SDG indicator 3.8.2 at the 10% threshold around the reference over a 5 year window around the reference year [T*–5; T*+5], linear interpolation is used to project the value of the proportion of “the population with household expenditures on health greater than 10% of total household expenditure or income” in the reference year. • If only one observed incidence rate of the SDG indicator 3.8.2 at the 10% threshold is available either before or after the reference year and within a five year window before or after the reference year (T*+ or T*-5),, a multilevel model of the rate of catastrophic payments (SDG indicator 3.8.2, 10% threshold) is ¬estimated using the aggregate share of out-of-pocket over total consumption expenditure as the explanatory variable • For countries with no observed incidence rate over a 10-year window around the reference year, the multilevel model is used to project the survey point to the reference year using the share of aggregate out-of-pocket over total consumption if that information is available. If such information is not available, the regional median value of the SDG indicator 3.8.2 at the 10% threshold is used instead to impute the incidence rate for those countries in the reference year. The country estimates for the reference year are then aggregated up to the regional and global levels to compute the “Total population with household expenditures on health greater than 10% of total household income or expenditure” in millions. The proportion of the total population at global and regional level is then calculated by expressing these numbers as a share of the relevant population, equivalent to taking a population-weighted average of the relevant country rates.""","Target is 0% of households spend more than 10% of income on health expenditures
